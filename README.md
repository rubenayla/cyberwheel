# CYBERWHEEL

Open-source electric unicycle hardware and firmware.

## ðŸ“– Documentation

Visit our documentation site: **[https://rubenayla.github.io/cyberwheel/](https://rubenayla.github.io/cyberwheel/)**

## Purpose
Make electric unicycles that are reliable for everyday use: waterproof, impact-resistant, durable over time, and easy to repair.

For this, create an open-source community to design both the Hardware and Firmware, so they can be repaired and modified, free of proprietary restrictions.
