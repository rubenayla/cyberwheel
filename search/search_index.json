They can go up curbs, down stairs, and sometimes even UP stairs. They're very pleasant to ride. Hands free, it feels like you're floating.</p> <p>They're way easier to carry around, like a little suitcase, so you can use them to park your car in the outskirts of the city and ride the couple km left to your destination, skipping traffic and parking fees. For short trips, it might even replace your car. Current ones get easily to 90 km/h, and exceed 100 km of range.</p>"},{"location":"#goals","title":"Goals","text":"<p>I want to challenge the idea that, if your EUC cuts out, it's your fault.
