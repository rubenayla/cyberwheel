# Firmware

Keep downloaded firmware, tool installers, and USB drivers here with source/URL and date. Label hardware targets clearly (Little FOCer ≈ VESC 75_300/LFV3 target).

Included (Mac):
- `macOS_VCP_Driver/SiLabsUSBDriverDisk.dmg` (Silicon Labs CP210x VCP driver installer, May 2025) and release notes.
  - Approval: In System Settings → Privacy & Security → Driver Extensions, ensure `CP210xVCPDriver (com.silabs.cp210x)` is enabled after install; allow “Silicon Laboratories Inc.” if prompted, then reboot.

Tip: store the exact VESC Tool version used to flash configs so you can reproduce results.
