# Safety
- [ ] Dynamic forces have been simulated
- [ ] Dynamic forces have been tested
- [ ] Fatigue tests have been performed (riding x km in rough terrain should work)
- [ ] Waterproofing test
    - The chassis keeps positive and negative pressure inside. The lighting panel should break/melt in case of fire, so it won't be a bomb.


# 
- [ ] The documentation fully explains the maintenance and safety procedures

> Could be cool to record these tests and let people propose and vote new tests to be performed.


## To consider
- [ ] Crazy test: Unplug the battery
    - It should enter emergency mode, spend all power available for leanback, and start braking with pwm control, dumping the energy slowly to the motor coils, in a stable deceleration with enough leeway to perform balancing.
